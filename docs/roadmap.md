markdown# NomadNet: Decentralized Anonymous Web Platform
## A Social Web Built on QuID Identity and Nym's Privacy-First Blockchain

### Abstract

NomadNet is a decentralized, anonymous web platform that combines social networking with a distributed content delivery system. Built on QuID's quantum-resistant identity protocol and Nym's privacy-preserving smart contract blockchain, NomadNet enables users to own their digital presence through .nomad domains while maintaining complete privacy and censorship resistance. The platform leverages Nym's zk-STARK infrastructure, adaptive economics, and storage optimizations to create a truly sovereign social web where creators have absolute authority over their space while preserving the integrity of distributed conversations.

    renewal_balance: NYM_Balance
    renewal_duration: Duration
    
    function auto_renew() -> Result<(), Error> {
        require!(current_time() > domain.expiration_date - 30_days)
        require!(renewal_balance >= calculate_renewal_cost())
        
        let payment_proof = generate_payment_proof(renewal_cost)
        domain.extend_expiration(renewal_duration, payment_proof)
        
        emit_event(DomainRenewed {
            domain_id: domain.id,
            new_expiration: domain.expiration_date
        })
    }
}
***

#### 2.2 Adaptive Domain Economics

***
Smart Contract Domain Pricing (adapts to Nym network health):

contract AdaptiveDomainPricing {
    base_prices: Map<DomainType, NYM_Amount>
    network_health_multiplier: Float32
    
    function calculate_domain_cost(
        domain_type: DomainType,
        duration: Duration
    ) -> NYM_Amount {
        let base_cost = base_prices[domain_type] * duration.years()
        let network_factor = get_network_health_factor()
        let burn_rate_factor = get_fee_burn_rate_factor()
        
        // Lower prices during high burn periods
        let adjusted_cost = base_cost * network_factor * burn_rate_factor
        adjusted_cost.clamp(base_cost * 0.5, base_cost * 2.0)
    }
    
    function get_network_health_factor() -> Float32 {
        let consensus_health = get_consensus_participation()
        let privacy_cost = get_average_zk_proof_cost()
        
        if privacy_cost > target_privacy_cost {
            0.8  // Subsidize domains when privacy is expensive
        } else if consensus_health < 0.67 {
            1.2  // Increase revenue for network security
        } else {
            1.0  // Normal pricing
        }
    }
}

Revenue Distribution Smart Contract:
contract DomainRevenue {
    total_revenue: NYM_Amount
    
    distribution_percentages: {
        network_security_fund: 35%,    // Hybrid PoW/PoS incentives
        platform_development: 25%,     // NomadNet development
        quid_foundation: 15%,          // Core identity protocol
        adaptive_token_burn: 15%,      // Burns more during low activity
        registrar_rewards: 10%         // Node operation incentives
    }
    
    function distribute_revenue(payment: NYM_Amount) {
        let network_activity = get_network_activity_level()
        let burn_amount = calculate_adaptive_burn(payment, network_activity)
        
        burn_tokens(burn_amount)
        distribute_to_funds(payment - burn_amount)
        
        emit_event(RevenueBurned { amount: burn_amount })
    }
}

### 3. Privacy-Enhanced Content Architecture

#### 3.1 zk-STARK Content Authentication

***
Content Structure with Privacy Proofs:

User Profile (alice.nomad):
{
  profile_info: {
    display_name: "Alice Cooper"
    bio: "Anonymous artist and privacy advocate"
    avatar_hash: SHAKE256

            engagement_proof: ZkStarkProof
        }
      }
    ]
    
    social_connections: {
      following: [QuID_List]
      followers: [QuID_List]  
      blocked: [EncryptedQuID_List]
      
      // Social graph privacy proofs
      connection_proofs: {
          mutual_friend_proof: ZkStarkProof
          follower_count_proof: ZkStarkProof
          social_weight_proof: ZkStarkProof
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Optional public revelation (like Nym transactions)
  public_revelations: Vec<PublicContentRevelation>
  
  content_version: Uint64
  signature: ML-DSA_Signature
}

Individual Post with Enhanced Privacy:

      authorization_timestamp: Uint64
      authorization_signature: ML-DSA_Signature
  }
}
***

#### 3.2 Storage Optimization with Cut-Through

***
NomadNet Storage Optimization:

Content Chain Cut-Through:
- Apply MimbleWimble-inspired optimizations to content history
- When content A → B → C (edits/versions), compress to A → C
- Maintain cryptographic integrity through zk-STARK proofs
- Preserve edit audit trail without storing full intermediate versions

Tiered Content Storage:
hot_storage: {
    data: "Recent content (<30 days)"
    size: "~5GB for 1M daily posts"
    requirements: "Fast SSD, full nodes"
}

warm_storage: {
    data: "Cut-through compressed content (30 days - 1 year)"
    size: "~1GB for historical content"
    requirements: "Standard storage, archive nodes"
}

cold_storage: {
    data: "Complete historical archive (>1 year)"
    size: "~20GB for complete platform history"
    requirements: "Archive nodes, IPFS integration"
}

Public Content Preservation:
- Explicitly public content never subject to cut-through
- Public revelations permanently stored on-chain
- Audit trail maintenance for compliance
- User controls what remains permanently public
